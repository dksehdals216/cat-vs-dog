implementatino of Kaggle's Cats vs Dogs dataset.
This project uses a vanilla cnn, and is part of a University Project.

Implemented with tensorflow, while the dense layer uses tflearn to simplify things.


Done:
    Show multiple results instead of a single result.
    Show random results instead of the first 16 that comes out from matplotlib.
    Implemented Batch normalization for layers and fully connected layer.

ToDo:
    Implement a Xavier initialization or any kind of initialization
